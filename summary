    <h1>A Summary Of Unquenchable Chaos</h1>
    <font face = "Times New Roman"><a href="https://cursedgenshin.fun"><p style="text-align:center;">Return Home</p></a>
    <p>= Remember when you called me horny? =</p>
  	<p>Revenge is a dish best served cold; <br>Cursed images brought to you tenfold</br></p>
    <p>Giving you previews of your sleep paralysis demon <br>Observe Ganyu eating flowers or watch Xiao eat a lemon</br>Would you like to have a look at some gay hilichurls? <br>Or maybe a picture of Keqing with no hair curls?</br><br>Zhongli in a maid outfit? Or Childe in a suit?</br>After looking at some images you'll be sure to become mute</br></p>
    <p>Scroll through pictures of Klee while the FBI's at your door <br>Go on, browse the rest, you know you want more</br>Catch a glimpse of Razor getting on all fours <br>Or go on a tour of extremely cursed lore</br></pr>
    <p>So what'll it be today? Hmm?</p>
    <p>You in a casket, guarded by Hu Tao? </br>Jean 'swearing by her sword' and making crazy vows?</br>Ganyu rolling down a cliff or Diluc in a dress? </br>You're gonna love this site cus it's a fcking mess<br></p>
    <p>You'll be overjoyed at the sight of #Xinyun <br>But maybe not so much at #ZhongliAndKunJun</br>A little bit of Beiguang and a slice of Chilumine <br>But don't be too horny - our eyes are very keen!</br><p>
